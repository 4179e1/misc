ID3 Editor is developed under Gtk2-2.16, I didn't test if it works on  the previous version of gtk.

To compile it, you need:
	gtk2-devel	(recommand 2.16 or later, since I didn't test previous version)

Install:
	cd source
	make
	make install

Uninstall:
	make uninstall


About windows:
	ID3 Editor could be complie and run on windows, but not recommand,
It doesn't works well, since a bug in gtk-win32: invalid UTF-8 in GtkEntry
cannon be cleared. By the way, i don't think windows user need this.
