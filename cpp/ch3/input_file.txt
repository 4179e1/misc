MooCat is a long-haired white kitten with large black patches. 
"Like a cow looks, only he is a kitty, poor kitty," Alice says, 
cradling MooCat in her arms, pretending he's not struggling to 
break free. MooCat is a present to Alice from her parents so 
that Alice does not feel so alone. Only she does. Like the 
gnarled leafless tree on the hilltop she and her father saw 
on their first walk together in the Tucson desert.
